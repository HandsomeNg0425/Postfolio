    description1: "I'm Ng Jian Yong, a software development student looking for an internship or full-time position in your company. A short introduction about me, I'm 22 years old and currently studying at Utmspace. Currently, I have just completed my full-time studies for 1 year and am preparing to study part-time for another year. Part-time study means that I study 1 night on weekdays and Saturdays. I can speak and write well in Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, and English. To be honest this will be my first job placement. But I have experience in projects combining them with my academic modules. My technical skills are more in web development. I have frontend experience like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React while my backend is more based on Spring which is Java based. For the database part, I learned MySQL.",
